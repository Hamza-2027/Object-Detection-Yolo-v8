# Object-Detection-Yolo-v8
1. Introduction - Definition: YOLO is an acronym for "You Only Look Once," a real-time object detection 
algorithm. - Purpose: Efficiently detect and locate objects in images or video frames. 
2. YOLO v8 Overview - YOLO v8: The eighth version of the YOLO series, known for improved accuracy and speed. - Architecture: Brief explanation of the neural network architecture used in YOLO v8. 
3. Key Features - One-Stage Detection: YOLO operates in a single pass through the neural network, making it 
faster than two-stage detectors. -Anchor Boxes:  YOLO uses anchor boxes to predict bounding boxes for different object sizes. 
4. Object Detection Process 
1. Input Image: Show an example input image. 
2. Grid Division: Explain how the image is divided into a grid. 
3. Bounding Box Prediction: YOLO predicts bounding boxes and confidence scores for each grid 
cell. 
4. Non-Maximum Suppression: Describe the process of removing redundant bounding boxes. 
5. YOLO v8 Advantages - Real-time Performance: YOLO v8 is designed for fast and efficient object detection. - High Accuracy: Discuss improvements in accuracy compared to previous YOLO versions. 
6. Use Cases - Autonomous Vehicles: YOLO v8 can be applied for real-time object detection in the context of 
self-driving cars. - Surveillance Systems: Discuss how YOLO v8 is useful for monitoring and security 
applications. 
7. Challenges and Limitations - Small Object Detection: Address challenges related to detecting small objects. - Complex Scenes: Discuss difficulties in crowded or complex scenes. 
8. Future Developments - Ongoing Research: Mention any ongoing research or future developments related to YOLO and 
object detection. 
9. Conclusion - Summarize the key points discussed in the presentation. - Highlight YOLO v8's significance in the field of computer vision.
